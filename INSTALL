To build and install, just run:

make
make install

The prtunnel binary will be installed to /usr/local/bin/prtunnel by default.
If you want a prefix other than /usr/local, change the PREFIX in the Makefile.
To compile prtunnel without IPv6 support, you must comment out or remove the
"CFLAGS+= -DIPV6" line in the Makefile.

Read the man page (`man prtunnel') for information on using it.
