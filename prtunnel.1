.SH NAME
.PP
prtunnel \- tunnels TCP connections through HTTP or SOCKS5 proxies
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B prtunnel
[-DVc6hv] [-t \fIproxy-type\fP] [-H \fIproxy-host\fP] [-P \fIproxy-port\fP] [-T \fIaddress\fP] [-u \fIusername\fP] [-p \fIpassword\fP] [--password-prompt] [--http-1.0] [--telnet-keep-alive \fIinterval\fP] [--crlf-keep-alive \fIinterval\fP] [--irc-auto-pong] [--timeout \fItime\fP] [--server-timeout \fItime\fP] [--help] [--version] \fIlocal-port\fP [\fIremote-host\fP \fIremote-port\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
prtunnel tunnels TCP connections through an HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy server. It is useful if you're behind such a proxy and want to use a program that doesn't have native proxy support.

\fIlocal-port\fP is the port that prtunnel will listen for a connection on. \fIremote-host\fP and \fIremote-port\fP are the hostname/address and port, respectively, of the remote server that the connection will be tunneled to.

If run without the <remote host> and <remote port> arguments, prtunnel will accept SOCKS4/SOCKS5 commands from the client to determine the remote server to connect to.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.IP "-D"
Run as a daemon. prtunnel will run in the background and accept multiple TCP connections with this option.
.IP "-V"
Turns on verbose output; all data transferred will be printed to standard output
.IP "-c"
Use color to differentiate between incoming and outgoing data in verbose output; without this, each line of outgoing verbose output will begin with ">>> " and incoming output with "<<< "
.IP "-6"
Enables IPv6 mode. This doesn't affect the way outgoing connections are made with the direct/direct6 tunneling modes; direct will always connect with IPv4 and direct6 will always connect with IPv6.
.IP "-t \fItunnel-mode\fP"
Set tunneling mode; http (default), socks5, direct and direct6 are supported. With http and socks5, you must specify the address of an http/socks5 proxy to use. direct will make prtunnel connect directly to the remote host specified; direct6 does the same, but with IPv6 instead of IPv4.
.IP "-H \fIproxy-host\fP"
Set proxy server hostname
.IP "-P \fIproxy-port\fP"
Set proxy server port; defaults are 8080 for http, 1080 for socks5
.IP "-T \fIaddress\fP"
Add a trusted address. For security reasons, only localhost is trusted by default. Only connections from trusted addresses are allowed. You can specify an address itself (like 10.0.0.0), or in the form of \fIaddress\fP/\fIbitcheck\fP, where \fIbitcheck\fP is the number of leading bits to compare; for example, \fI10.0.0.0/24\fP would mean any address in the range of 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255.
.IP "-u \fIusername\fP"
Set username to use for proxy authentication
.IP "-p \fIpassword\fP"
Set password to use for proxy authentication
.IP "--password-prompt"
Prompt for proxy username and password
.IP "--http-1.0"
Use HTTP/1.0 instead of HTTP/1.1 for HTTP connections
.IP "--telnet-keep-alive \fIinterval\fP"
Causes prtunnel to send keep-alive data at the specified interval, using the telnet NOP command
.IP "--crlf-keep-alive \fIinterval\fP"
Causes prtunnel to send keep-alive data at the specified interval, using a CRLF (this works for some text-based protocols)
.IP "--irc-auto-pong"
Causes prtunnel to automatically respond to PING commands sent by IRC servers.
.IP "--timeout \fItime\fP"
Allows you to set a client socket timeout; if no data is recieved from the client for <time> seconds, the connection will be closed
.IP "--server-timeout \fItime\fP"
Allows you to set a server socket timeout; if no data is recieved from the remote host for <time> seconds, the connection will be closed
.IP "-h, --help"
Show help message
.IP "-v, --version"
Show version information
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
.B prtunnel -H proxy 6667 irc.freenode.net 6667
.PP
After starting prtunnel like this, you could then point an IRC client to 127.0.0.1, and prtunnel will attempt to connect you to irc.freenode.net via the HTTP proxy server on a system named "proxy".
